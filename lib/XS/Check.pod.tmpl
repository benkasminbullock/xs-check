=head1 NAME

XS::Check - check XS for problems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use XS::Check;
    my $check = XS::Check->new ();
    $check->check_file ('some.xs');

=head1 VERSION

This documents version [% info.version %] of XS::Check corresponding to
L<git commit [% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo %]/commit/[%
commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Check XS files for errors.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $check = XS::Check->new ();

=head2 check

    $check->check ($xs);

See L</SUGGESTIONS> for what this reports.

=head2 check_file

    $check->check ($xs_file);

Convenience method to read in $xs_file then run L</check> on it.

This assumes UTF-8 encoding of $xs_file.

=head1 SUGGESTIONS

This section details the possible suggestions made by the module and
the motivations behind them.

=head2 Use STRLEN in SvPV

Using an int type for the second argument to SvPV may cause errors on
64-bit Perls.

=head2 Use const char * for return value of SvPV

Be careful to not overwrite Perl's own buffer, which SvPV returns.

=head2 Don't use malloc/calloc/realloc/free

Replace with Newx etc. 

These cause "free to wrong pool" errors on multithreaded Windows
Perls.
